<h1>Project_One:  Berlin Airbnb Data </h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. This project aims to create a blog post and Github repository to
begin building a data science portfolio of my own. For that, I choose Kaggle's Berlin Airbnb Data and
followed the CRISP-DM process to conduct my analyze.</p>
<h2>Installation and libraries</h2>
<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> What are the busiest times of the year to visit Berlin? By how much do prices spike?</li>
  <li> Can you predict the price for each Berlin neighborhood using the columns with more correlation with it?</li>
  <li> How the distance from the Berlin's downtown is correlated to the price?</li>
</ul>
